        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our project page! Our objective is to develop an advanced foot-on-line detector from photographs, using cutting-edge computer vision techniques implemented in Python. This technology is designed to help sports professionals, coaches, and athletes enhance performance and ensure compliance with game rules.</p>

        <h2>Utility in Sports</h2>
        <p>In many sports, such as tennis, volleyball, and basketball, precise foot placement is crucial for optimal performance and adherence to game rules. The foot-on-line detector provides several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Accuracy:</strong> Automatically detects if a player's foot crosses a critical line, reducing human error and ensuring accurate decisions during gameplay.</li>
            <li><strong>Training Aid:</strong> Assists athletes and coaches in training sessions by providing instant feedback on foot positioning, which can be used to refine techniques and strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule Compliance:</strong> Helps referees and officials make precise decisions about rule violations, which is crucial in competitive sports where every point counts.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Analysis:</strong> Provides detailed analysis of foot positioning and movement, helping in the overall assessment of player performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our foot-on-line detector utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze photographs of athletes. The process involves:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> Enhancing and preparing the photograph for analysis, including adjustments to contrast and clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Foot Detection:</strong> Using computer vision algorithms to locate and track the foot in the image.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Detection:</strong> Identifying the critical lines on the playing surface and determining their position relative to the detected foot.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Assessing whether the foot is on or off the line and providing an output based on predefined criteria.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results and Future Work</h2>
        <p>Initial results from our prototype are promising, showing accurate foot detection and line crossing determination. Future work will focus on improving the robustness of the detector in various lighting conditions and with different foot positions.</p>
